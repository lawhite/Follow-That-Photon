# Follow-That-Photon
Twine-based educational Choose Your Own Adventure game for DES EPO

Current: 4/12/2017

Below are the notes from the DES EPO meeting of 1/17/17

Initial commit is two files:

1. The skeleton of the game (air-quotes--maybe adventure really is a better term than game) is Follow that Photon!.html. You can step through it. A few of the topics are filled in, and the remainder have notes about what I propose to include in them. 

2. FTP.png is a screen capture of the map. I hope you can make it out.

General comments: Nice astronomy art can be used as backgrounds, and there's some simple logic available that should work pretty well with this.  What I need help with is fairly simple and noted in the topics, but I may be so off-base about the science that I'm just wrong on what I should include. 

If I'm on the right track I will submit a schedule for filling in the remaining topics, starting with ones that everyone agrees should be included. 

Twine website! You can either download and install Twine or use the browser-based version on the website to import and look at the game. 
NOTE: IF YOU MAKE CHANGES, EXPORT TO HTML.

Action Items:
1. Put on github [Lori]: Done
2. Open the game in the html file (from your email) and scroll down to first topic. Read and comment on specific origins and wavelengths for photons that could (a) ultimately be detected by DECam and (b) Could reach Earth and/or DECam but are not detectable. (For example, UV, X-ray, etc.)  [All]
3. Suggest ideas for for what could occur to a photon that would interrupt the game -- e.g., fall into a black hole?  [All]
